## Background
This repository contains the set of automatically generated C++ source files that describe the RESTful API endpoints that provide key service functionality to the [Connected Space Platform](https://github.com/magnopus-opensource/connected-spaces-platform).

For those seeking to build their own services compatible with CSP, these source files can be considered a spec from which other RESTful services can be built.
